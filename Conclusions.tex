\section{Conclusions}

One of the hardest tasks in this practice, was coding the CRC algorithm according with the XOR division, the team made many attempts before having a correct CRC algorithm. \\

It was corroborated that the physical impairments disturbed the message as the distance was increasing, this was proved not only  during Arduino console messages but also by ploting the FER, FRIIS equation and the capacity of the channel.It was seen the differece between the polynomials and how they affected the FER calculated.  The algorithm notice correctly how the frames where arriving and how many of them where correct and incorrect.\\

 We conclude  is of great importance to have error detection methods in order that the  correction methods work the best.
